# Controller_Testing_Practice

This is a simple application where I wanted to practice testing my API Controllers with React.js Frontend
with a Ruby on Rails Backend.

To run this on your computer, please do the following in your terminal:

bundle
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
rails s
npm install
npm start

You should be able to navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser and see an index page of gifs with a form to add a new gif.
